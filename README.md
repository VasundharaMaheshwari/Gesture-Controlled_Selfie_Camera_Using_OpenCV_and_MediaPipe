-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Embarked on a revolutionary learning journey with our creation: Prototype Gesture-Controlled Selfie Camera. We've harnessed OpenCV and MediaPipe to fashion a tool that not only captures milestones but also serves as a tangible chronicle of our unique learning approach and growth.
Our project stands on the shoulders of various tutorials but we took it further to create an application that interacts.
Each gesture captures our innovative approach, reflecting our understanding and expertise in applying tutorial concepts.
As a prototype, our Gesture-Controlled Selfie Camera might encounter glitches and that's okay. These imperfections signify a space for improvement, reflecting the iterative nature of learning.
Our project saw moments of frustration as we debugged code. Yet, each obstacle was an opportunity to learn, solidifying our problem-solving skills.
